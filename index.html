            <h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                We created a smoke simulator using the Three.js framework and WebGL.
                The simulator itself models a fluild system with zero viscosity based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The user can
                then insert color, desnity, and temperature quantities (the "smoke") that applies buoyant forces to the fluid. Additionally,
                internal values computed at each time step can be visualized for a better understanding of the internals of the simulator.
                Navigate to the simulation <a href="simulation/index.html">here</a> (or on the navigation bar above). 
                Also checkout our explanation video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jITxj5rsuUY&feature=youtu.be">here</a>!
                Note: This simulator has only been tested for Google Chrome.

            </p>
            <h2 align="left">Frameworks and Web Tool</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Three.js was what we used to visualize and animate the simulation. 
                Then with the help of WebGL, a Javascript API, we were able to include our graphics in the form of a website. 
                Other tools that we used include dat.gui to allow the user to adjust certain internal and visualization parameters.
            </p>
            
            <h2 align="left">Concepts</h2>
		    <p align="justify">
                The formulas used to compute the flow of the fluid at each time step were derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations for incompressible flow:

                From this equation, we can see that the movement of a fluid at a point is determined by four components:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Advection: Transportation of quantities in the fluid in relation to the fluid's vector field. In fact, the fluid even advects it's own veclocity field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pressure: The internal forces of the fluid caused by it colliding with itself. Computationally, this will be the most expensive field to track.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Diffusion: A factor determining the viscosity of the fluid. Air particles have nealy zero viscosity, so this field was ignored.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        External Forces: Whatever external forces are currently acting on the fluid. Since we are creating a smoke simulator, we will have to account for a buoyant force in order for the smoke to rise.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                            The main pipeline executed at each time step is used to determine the next velocity field of the fluid by computing and applying the components determined
                            by the Navier-Stokes Equations. In addition to this pipeline, a benign "ink" value is also advected to for the sake of visualizing the smoke.

            <p align="justify">
                In order to utilize the GPU to efficiently update a field of values, we utilized shaders to apply operations to our quantity field "textures". A brief description of our
            utilized shaders is listed below.  
            </p>

                            As said before, <strong>Advection</strong> is the displacement of a quantity via the vector field. Implementation-wise, we used an implicit method to "trace back" a vector quantity at a fragment.
                            From this backward step, we can bilinearly interpolate the quantity to be advected from the four neighboring fragments, and then update the original fragment with this interpolated
                            value. This implementation adds the benefit of being a generally more stable, implicit method than being a more traditional forward-step implementation.

                            As a future endeavor, we would like to incorporate an additional external foce that would be created by the movement of the mouse.

                            This step updates the velocity field to account for pressure. There are three steps that occur during this phase:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Computing the divergence of the velocity field.</li>
                                <li>Solving the Poisson equation for pressure p using Jacobi iteration.</li>
                                <li>Subtracting the Gradient of p from the velocity field.</li>
                            </ol>
                            A seperate shader was used for each of these steps. The actual solving for the pressure equation is an iterative method that introduces a trade-off between accuracy and computation
                            resources: the more times the Jacobi operator is applied to our pressure field, the more convergent out computer pressure becomes. It was recommended to us to run somewhere between 40-50
                            operations per time step, and never going below 20.

        <h2 align="left">Additional Shaders</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            Additional shaders were used to enhance the user experience. A "splat" shader was created to add a quantity across a field in the form of a gaussian distribution. When the user clicks
            the mouse, this shader is used to insert "smoke" (or, more precisely, color, density, and temperature quantities).
            Other shaders were made for the purpose of visualizing the different quantity fields that were being utilized. The sole purpose of these shaders were to map values on a field to corresponding
            color values. As most of our fields were scalar values, we simply used a scale and biasing scheme for this conversion. For our velocity field, we went with a different scheme of mapping a 
            vector's direction and magnitude to a color's hue and value, respectively, in respect to the HSV color scheme.
        </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Bugs/Future Goals</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            While most known issues seem to have been fixed, we are aware of a few shortcomings of our simulator:
            <ul>
                <li>Upon clicking the mouse, the point of creating for the smoke does not line up with the center of the mouse. While an attempt was made to rectify this, priority was given to non-ui elements for this project. </li>
                <li>The environment does not scale accordingly after resizing the window. Once again, this has not been resolved to our focus on non-ui elements. </li>
                <li>While not necessarily a bug, the simulator can be pretty computationally expensive. It would be prudent to look into some methods to optimize the pipeline.</li>
            </ul>

            Additionally, there are some additional features that we would like to have implemented in the future:
            <ul>
                <li>An attempt was made to include a rectangular boundary to the enviornment, but it wasn't operational by the time of submission.</li>
                <li>As a step farther from the previous goal, we would also like to have the ability to include more complicated boundary objects (e.g. a sphere)</li>
                <li>As mentioned previously, the ability to apply forces onto the fluid through the movement of the mouse would add good interactivity.</li>
                <li>Incorporating a diffusion element to our pipeline would allow us to simulate more viscous fluids</li>
                <li>Adding a vorticity step to our pipeline to attempt to more accurately mimic turbulent motion.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
